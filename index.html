                    <p>
                        I am a web development student with skills in front end development. Since the days where Flash
                        programming was innovative, I have always had an interest in creating websites and Flash
                        animations as a hobby. My background as a scientist has instilled a level of curiosity in the
                        unknown and honed my passion for solving complex problems. In the next phase of my career, I
                        would like to apply my problem-solving skills to back-end development and its many technical
                        facets. I am seeking a role in full stack development where I can continue to learn new skills,
                        grow in the field and continually master my craft.
